* [Acquiring the Media Id](#start/media_id)
* [Initialization within the code](#start/init)

This guide summarizes SDK usage.

For the detailed API specification, see the comments in each header file within the framework.

<a name="start/media_id"></a>
## Acquisition of Media Id

Register from the management screen to issue the Media Id.

**(At the current stage, inquiries should be made to the representative)**

This Media ID uses the app identification, so be sure not to forget this.

<!--
###Test ID
Media Id 1 may be used for testing. The dummy data will be displayed and may confirm operation.
Media Id 2 can be used for other than interstitial advertisements. Since the main data are displayed, it can be used to confirm the appearance.
//-->

<a name="start/init"></a>
## Initialization within the code

RFP is initialized with the media_id acquired as described above as the argument.

Unless there is a particular reason, stipulate as

[UIApplicationDelegate -application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/uikit/reference/UIApplicationDelegate_Protocol/Reference/Reference.html#//apple_ref/occ/intfm/UIApplicationDelegate/application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:)



```objc
// (1) Specifying the header file
#import <RFP/RFP.h>

// (2) Calling the initialization method
- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions
{
    [RFP rfpInitMedia:@"your_media_id"];

    // ...
}
```

Please note that **unless initialization takes place, the general acquisition of advertisements, to be described later, cannot be performed**.
